# Stacker-Forge
Minecraft mod to change the stack size of all items. For Forge 1.17.x ~ 1.19.x.

Note: This mod has a config that defaults to 64. 
Change it to be whatever you like (below int_max), but I do not recommend anything too far over 1 Billion (No support will be given for stacks larger than 1,073,741,823).

Requires Cloth Config API.
